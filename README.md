Hello World! I am Sougata Saha, a PhD student @ University at Buffalo, New York. Advised by Dr. Rohini K. Srihari, my research interests lie in conversational systems, deep learning, and natural language processing.

## Research
- Autobots Ensemble: Identifying and Extracting Adverse Drug Reaction from Tweets using Transformer Based Pipelines : Implemented a text mining system which advances Pharmacovigilance in social media, by extracting and normalizing drug adverse reaction mentions from social media tweets. Accepted in SMM4H 2020
- Document mining and retrieval in a conversational setting targeted to COVID-19 queries : Implemented a GPT-2 based conversational system which leverages Information Retrieval techniques coupled with state-of-the-art neural based methods to mine answers from Covid-19 medical literature, and presents it to the user in a conversational way. Accepted in SBP-BRiMS 2020.
- Covid-19 QnA : Created an information extraction system which leverages state of the art BERT based architectures for retrieving and extracting relevant information related to Covid-19, from medical literature. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datawiz/covid19-literature-mining-ub
- Team Naam-pAI : First runners up in the eBay University Machine Learning Competition 2019: https://evalai.cloudcv.org/web/challenges/challenge-page/462/overview
