## Introduction

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the NLP department of [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research/department/natural-language-processing-department/), Abu Dhabi, and advised by [Dr. Monojit Choudhury](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/monojit-choudhury/). My current research focuses on the intersection of culture and LLMs, encompassing the cultural alignment of LLMs and gearing LLMs for diverse aspects of culture. I graduated with a PhD in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering.html) from the [University of Buffalo, New York](https://www.buffalo.edu/), in Spring 2024. Focusing on argumentation mining from discourse and [persuasive conversational systems](https://www.proquest.com/openview/a227cff6ab3e14cd65a169acdc758322/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y), I was advised by [Dr. Rohini K. Srihari](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~rohini/). My broader research interests include purposeful conversational systems such as conversational systems for persuasion, deliberation, and negotiation and studying their cross-cultural use.
